# SQL Mastery with CampusX

A comprehensive repository of SQL practice files based on the **CampusX - Database and SQL Full Course (DSMP 2023)** playlist. This project is a hands-on journey through the core concepts of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and SQL, ranging from DDL/DML queries to complex subqueries and window functions.

> 📌 Playlist followed: [CampusX - Basic DBMS and SQL Full](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvbY-7TjHytIcGk3xE4Ykv2s)  
> 🧠 Taught by: **CampusX**  
> 📅 Duration: 7 Sessions (15+ Hours)
